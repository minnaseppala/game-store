**Instructions for the project plan:**
1) The names and student numbers of the team members
2) General description of what you are doing and how you are doing that (which features you plan to implement)
    a) What features you plan to implement?
    b) Are there some extra features not listed in the project description what you plan to implement?
    c) For each feature, how do you plan to implement it?
3) Initial ideas of what kinds of views and models are needed, how they relate to each other. Pay attention to the models - the better the initial guess, the faster you get to implement things as changes to models briefly interrupt the whole team. Give an initial draft of what models you plan to have and what fields those models have. Note that Django already has a user model.
4) How are you going to work? Adding information on how you plan on working on the project is recommended as well (will you meet face-to-face regularly, will use some project management tools, etc.)
5) Describe the implementation order and timetable.
